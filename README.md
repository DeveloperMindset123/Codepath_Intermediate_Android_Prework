## Notes

Since it was my first time using Firebase, although implementing google authentication is a very simplified/efficient approach toward implementing login, I had to tinker around with the code, refer to documentation and tutorials in an attempt to undeerstand why it wasn't working as intended initially. Additionally, android studio can cause a lot of errors when it comes to build failures due to dependancy mismatch, starting with having to uninstall and reinstall different JDK versions, changing gradle settings in order for build to compile as well as check if all plugins and version dependancies match took up around 10-12 hours to fix, but nonetheless, it was a fun and challenging experience. Only downside is that android emulators can be quite slow, in comparison to IOS counterparts, hence many android developers have an android phone which they use for physical debugging, it is comparably much faster alternative to emulators, and fortunately, I myself also have an android phone to utilize for demo/debugging. I wish to make more complex projects in android and potentially deploy them onto Google Play Store in the coming months.
